# Companion Cube - a modular mold
... resulting in a 80 x 80 x 80 mm concrete-cube wich weights ~1.000 gramms.
This project aims to provide and improve a reusable, modular and configurable, 3D-printable mold, out of which a solid brick can be released.

It's meant to be come out rough and basic, but with nicly angled, concrete-loving edges.
A simple system keeps all the parts of the mold in place, tight enough to allow even viscous concrete to cure without leakage.

## About
### Whats the cube for?
Initially the cube is meant to be a solid, handcrafted gift for people you care about, like collegues, friends and family.

### Configurable / Modular
3D-Printed logos, graphics, text or placeholder can be added (e.g. glued) to the side-walls of the mold. These "placeholders" can be pulled out of the concrete block once the initial curing is done.
See tips & tricks in the readme or example folder for propper design of these elements, so you can actually remove them later on.

I preferred weaker glue so in case the pieces get stuck, at least the wall can be released and the a carefull leftover removal can be done

## Preparation
## Printing the pieces
* the parts have been created with Printing-Process-Restrictions in mind.
** no support structure needed
* Settings to produce good results
** layer-height 0.1 - 0.15 (bigger will consume all of the 0.1 mm part-spacing)
** 0.4 nozzle is fine
** heated bed / fan is helpfull
** PLA works perfectly since grease / oil / water / spray-paint wont harm it, and sanding can be done to reduce printed ripples
** the basic mold parts should be printed as strong as possible
*** min. 35% infill (50% infilled parts might survive about 5-10 casts)
*** min. 1.2mm walls
*** stronger is better, since demolding can be slightly forcefull

** print the 4 side-walls in one row using the side_wall_quadro.stl, they stabilize each other and no overhang issues occur
*** carefully tilting the 4 connected pieces, repeatingly will separate them eventually

## How-to create one brick
### Tools / Material
* nicely fitting (assembled) mold, with attached (glued) modifications
** opt. mold-release agent (e.g. WD40, Silikon Spray, Butter)
* a spoon, tough one
* a bowl to mix the concrete (volume 1 to 1.5 liters)
* tap-water in a bottle
* ~ 1.5kg finegrain concrete
** up to 8 mm grain size
** fast-curing helps
** "add-water-only-concrete"
* a scale (with tara / tare option)
* optional mold-release agent (e.g. Silikon Spray, some oil or Butter)
* optional but recomended dust-protection for your mouth, gloves

### Mix it / pour it
* make sure the top is covered by the top_plate_inset
** tape or rubberband helps keeping things in place
** turn it around so the top becomes the bottom
* opt. apply release agent
* pre-calculate the amount of water required for 1.5 kg according to the concrete-package
* mix concrete calculated amount of water
** stirr it equally - should not be too liquid, rather sticky
*** the pefect mix will not release any water
** pour it spoon by spoon into the mold
** if the concrete touches edges or modifications, tap / rattle gently on the walls to remove air-bubbles on the edges
** fill until the the concrete touches the upper end of the 45deg inner edge of the plate
** smoothen the surface, tapping the walls

# Troubleshooting
* pieces dont fit at all
** please check wall orientation
** any support-structure needs to be avoided or removed / sanded
** your printer might have over-extrusion

* pieces fit too tight, break during assembly
** check alignment
** sand the connecting edges
** move the pieces gently, to cause some wear

* demolding sucks
** yes it does, but your mold will release easier with every cast
** tap (with the spoon...) , gently on all edges to cause small movement
* walls bended a little
** the concrete curing exposes heat, this could cause deformation of the PLA

** the pieces have a 0.1 mm tolerance to conecting sides and parts, that will care for occuring printing tolerances
*** if the pieces fit too tight and tend to break, you can sand the edges a little with 120 / 240 sanding-paper
