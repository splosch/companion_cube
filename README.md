# Companion Cube - Configurable Mold
This project aims to create and improve a modular and configurable, 3D-printable mold, out of which you can create a (concrete-) cube.
Designed for creation of basic shape concrete-cubes a simple system keeps all the parts of the mold in place, tight enough to allow even viscous concrete to cure without leakage.

## Configurable / Modular
3D-Printed logos, graphics, text or placeholder can be added (e.g. glued) to the side-walls of the mold. These "placeholders" can be pulled out of the concrete block once the initial curing is done.
See tips & tricks in the readme or example folder for propper design of these elements, so you can actually remove them later on.

## Whats the cube for?
Initially the cube is meant to be a solid, handcrafted gift for people you care about, like collegues, friends and family.
